# Python Sort Script

python script to sort files into directories based on file extension
it makes a set of extensions and creates directories based on that extension like:  
`mp3Directory mp4Directory`  
then it moves the file to the extension directory  
it accepts one argument `directory` and if it isn't defined it sort the current directory  
you can run the script on the test directory by running the following command:  
`python3 sort.py ./test`
